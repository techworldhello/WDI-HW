Use the starter code and commit each step of the exercise.

- Work in small steps and commit frequently.
- When you're finished, push your solution and issue a **pull request**.
- Feel free to use jQuery.

### Commit 1

* When I click the "Set Color" button, it should change the color of the "brush" box to the color I specify in the input field.
* Use jQuery or native DOM API to select the element and add an event listener

> **HINT:** You will notice that the page refreshes whenever you click the button. You need to prevent this from happening using a method you have not used before. Google "javascript event prevent default".

### Commit 2

* The same thing should happen when I press the enter key from inside the input field

### Commit 3

* Create 1000 divs of the "square" class and append them to the body. The square class should specify a width of 20px and height 20px

### Commit 4

* Add functionality so that when I click on each "square", it changes the color of that individual square to "green"
  * **Hint**: either add the event listener while creating the squares, or listen for events on the parent element

### Commit 5

* Modify your code so that when I click on each "square", it changes to the color I set using my input instead of "green" every time.

### Commit 6

* Change the event that changes your box colors from 'click' to 'mouseover'

### Commit 7

* add another form to allow users to pick a movie poster using the OMDB API.
* set the background to the movie poster fetched from the api.

### Commit 8

* feel free to tweak the styling, the size and number of pixels to make it look pretty.
